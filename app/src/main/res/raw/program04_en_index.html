<H3>4. Training of the choice reaction with distraction</H3>
Training device: <br>
• Ring - initial position and the end of the exercise.<br/>
• High tone signal - execute action "A".<br/>
• Low tone signal - execute action "B".<br/>
• Double signal - ignore.<br/>
<br/>
The simulator will model for you the situation in a fencing bout or during an individual lesson, when you need to choose between two alternative actions.
At the same time you should ignore the false actions of your opponent.
<H4>Exercise 1.</H4>
Imagine that you want to execute an attack to the opponent's opening sector.  But you will not react to the opponent's approaches. <br/>
<B>Initial position: </B>Middle distance (lunge distance), enguarde position. You are constantly moving with one step forward - one step backwards.<br>
With the high tone signal execute a direct attack with the lunge to the left side. With the low tone signal execute a direct attack with the lunge to the right side. Do not react to the double signal.
<H4>Exercise 2.</H4>

With the high tone signal execute parry quinte with step back and riposte with a lunge to the mask. With the low tone signal execute a parry quarte with step back and riposte with a lunge to the mask.  Do not react to the double signal.
