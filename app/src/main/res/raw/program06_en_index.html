<H3>6. Training of the switching reaction with destraction</H3>
Training device: <br>
• Ring – initial position and the end of the exercise.<br>  
• High tone signal – execute action.<br>
• Low tone signal – switch from the action “A” to the action “B”.<br>
• Double signal – ignore.<br>
<br>
The simulator will model for you the situation in a fencing bout or during an individual lesson, when you need to switch from one action to another. At the same time you should ignore the false actions of your opponent.
<H4>Exercise 1.</H4>
Imagine that during your attack you will see the correct counter attack of your opponent and will switch to a parry riposte. At the same time you should ignore the false actions of your opponent<br>.
<B>Initial position:</B> Long distance (step lunge distance), enguard position<br>.
With the high tone signal execute a direct attack with a step forward lunge.  If during the execution of the attack you hear the low tone signal – switch to the circular six parry and riposte. Do not react to the double signal<br>.
<H4>Exercise 2.</H4>
Imagine that during your attack to the outside sector you will see the early parry six of your opponent and will switch to the inside sector. At the same time you should ignore the false actions of your opponent<br>.
<B>Initial position:</B> Long distance (step lunge distance), enguard position<br>.
With the high tone signal execute a direct attack with the step forward lunge to the outside sector of the target.  If during the execution of the attack you hear the low tone signal – switch to the hit to the inside sector<br>.
<H4>Exercise 3.</H4>
Imagine that your opponent disengages your parry and you need to switch to another one. Do not react to the double signal<br>.
<br>
<B>Initial position:</B>  Close distance, eight position<br>.
With the high tone signal execute a parry six with a step back and riposte with a lunge. If during the execution of the parry you hear the low tone signal – execute one more step back, a circular parry six, and riposte with the step lunge<br>.
