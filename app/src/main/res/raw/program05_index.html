<h3>5. Training of the switching reaction</h3>
Training device:<br>
• Ring - initial position and the end of the exercise.<br>
• High tone signal - execute action.<br>
• Low tone signal - switch from the action “A" to the action “B".<br>
<br>
The simulator will model for you the situation in a fencing bout or during an individual lesson, when you need to switch from one action to another.<br>
For example to change from one sector to another during the execution of the attack, parry the correct counter attack of your opponent, or switch to a counter riposte.<br>
<h4>Exercise 1.</h4>
Imagine that during your attack you will see the correct counter attack of your opponent and will switch to a parry riposte.<br>
<b>Initial position:</b>  Long distance (step lunge distance), enguard position.<br>
With the high tone signal execute a direct attack with the step forward lunge.  If during the execution of the attack you hear the low tone signal - switch to the quarte parry and riposte.<br>
<h4>Exercise 2.</h4>
Imagine that during your attack to the inside sector you will see the early parry quarte of your opponent and will switch to the outside sector.<br>
<b>Initial position:</b>  Long distance (step lunge distance), enguard position.<br>
With the high tone signal execute a direct attack with the step forward lunge to the inside sector of the target.  If during the execution of the attack you hear the low tone signal - switch to the hit to the outside sector.<br>
<h4>Exercise 3.</h4>
Imagine that your opponent disengages your parry and you need to switch to another one.<br>
<b>Initial position:</b>  Close distance, enguard position.<br>
With the high tone signal execute a quarte parry with a step back and riposte with a lunge. If during the execution of the parry you hear the low tone signal - execute one more step back, a six parry, and riposte with the step lunge.<br>
