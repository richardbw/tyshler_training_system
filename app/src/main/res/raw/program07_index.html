<H3>7. Training of anticipation of the distance</H3>
The training device will specialize your perception of the distance and timing for fencing. The simulator will model for you the situation in a fencing bout or during an individual lesson, when you need to prolong or shorten your attack or to change the moment when you need to start execution of a particular action.  This training mode will help to improve your footwork combinations and coordination.
