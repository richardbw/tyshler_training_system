<h3>3. Training of the choice reaction</h3>
Training device: <br>
• Ring - initial position, end of the exercise.<br>
• High tone signal - execute action "A". <br>
• Low tone signal - execute action "B".<br>
<br/>
The simulator will model for you the situation in a fencing bout or during the individual lesson, when you need to choose between two alternative actions. For example, an attack to the opening sector (inside or outside) or a parry tierce and quarte. 
<h4>Exercise 1.</h4>
Imagine that you want to execute an attack to the opponent's opening sector.<br>
<b>Initial position:</b> Middle distance (lunge distance), enguard position.<br>
With the high tone signal execute a direct attack with the lunge to the left side. With the low tone signal execute a direct attack with the lunge to the right side.
<h4>Exercise 2.</h4>
Imagine that you are expecting a direct attack from your opponent but are not sure if it will be to the inside sector or outside sector.<br>
<b>Initial position:</b> Close distance (direct hit distance), enguard position. You are constantly moving with one step forward - one step backwards.<br>
With the high tone signal execute a parry tierce with a step back and riposte with a lunge to the mask. With the low tone signal - a parry quarte with step back and riposte with a lunge to the mask.
<h4>Exercise 3.</h4>  
Imagine that you want to execute a parry riposte or an attack on the preparation against the opponent who arbitrarily alternates direct attacks and short preparative approaches.<br>
<b>Initial position: </b>Middle distance (lunge distance), enguard position.<br>
With the low tone signal execute a parry quinte with a step back and riposte to the mask with a step forward lunge. With the high tone signal - execute a direct attack with lunge to the mask.<br>
