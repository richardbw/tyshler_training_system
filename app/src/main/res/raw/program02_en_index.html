<h3>2. Training of simple motor reaction with distraction</h3>
Training device: <br>
• Ring - initial position and the end of the exercise.<br>
• High tone signal - execute.<br>
• Double signal - ignore. <br>
<br>
The simulator will model for you the situation in a fencing bout or during the individual lesson, when you need to respond to an action of your opponent (coach) with a simple conditioned premeditative action. But you should ignore his false actions.<br>
<H4>Exercise 1.</H4>
Imagine that you want to execute a direct attack on the opponent who will move his weapon into low position. But you will not react to any other movements of his weapon.<br/>
<B>Initial position:</B> Middle distance (lunge distance), enguard position. <br>
With the high tone signal perform direct attack with the lunge to the mask. Do not react to the double signal.
<H4>Exercise 2.</H4>
Imagine that you want to perform a parry and riposte against the direct attack of your opponent to the inside sector. But you will not react to his false attacks.<br/>
<B>Initial position:</B>Middle distance (lunge distance), enguard position. You are constantly moving with one step forward - one step backwards.<br>
With the high tone signal perform one step backwards, execute a quarte parry and riposte with a lunge to the mask. Do not react to the double signal.
<H4>Exercise 3.</H4>
Imagine that you are planning a premeditative response attack. But you will not react to the opponent's short approaches. <br/>
<B>Initial position:</B> Middle distance (lunge distance), enguard position.<br>
With the high tone signal perform one active step backwards and execute the respond attack to the mask with a step forward and a lunge. Do not react to the double signal.<br>
